## Visualization

- [ ] **ASCII Charts**: Add simple ASCII/Unicode charts to visualize burn rates and alert thresholds directly in the terminal
- [ ] **Export to SVG/PNG**: Allow exporting visualizations to image formats for inclusion in documentation
- [ ] **Burn Rate Graphs**: Visualize how quickly error budgets would be consumed at different error rates
- [ ] **Alert Timeline**: Show when alerts would trigger on a timeline based on different error scenarios

- [ ] **Implementation Examples**: Include sample configurations for popular monitoring systems

## Usability Features

- [ ] **Saved Configurations**: Allow saving and loading of common configurations
- [ ] **Presets**: Provide industry-standard presets for common service types
- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Process multiple services or configurations in a single run
- [ ] **What-If Analysis**: Allow users to simulate different error scenarios and see the impact
- [ ] **Recommendations**: Provide smart recommendations based on service characteristics
- [ ] **Alert Tuning Guidance**: Offer suggestions for adjusting alerts if they're too sensitive or not sensitive enough

## Educational Components

- [ ] **Explanation Mode**: Add verbose mode that explains the mathematical reasoning behind recommendations
- [ ] **Built-in Examples**: Include real-world examples that users can explore
- [ ] **Tooltips/Help**: Contextual help for each parameter explaining its impact
- [ ] **Best Practices**: Include best practices guidance alongside recommendations
- [ ] **Warning System**: Warn users when configurations might lead to alert fatigue or missed incidents
- [ ] **Interactive Tutorial**: Create guided walkthroughs for first-time users
- [ ] **Visual Guide**: Develop visual explanations of multi-window, multi-burn-rate alerting concepts

## Integration Capabilities

- [ ] **API Mode**: Run as a service with REST API endpoints for integration with other tools
- [ ] **Import from Monitoring**: Import service metrics from monitoring systems to inform recommendations
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: Provide ways to validate SLO configurations in CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] **Webhook Support**: Send results to webhooks for integration with chat platforms or other tools
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Allow extending functionality through plugins
- [ ] **Monitoring System Templates**: Provide ready-to-use templates for implementing alerts in various systems

## Advanced Features

- [ ] **Multi-Service Analysis**: Analyze dependencies between services and suggest coordinated SLOs
- [ ] **Historical Analysis**: Import historical error data to validate SLO configurations
- [ ] **Seasonality Detection**: Detect and account for traffic patterns and seasonality
- [ ] **Machine Learning**: Use ML to suggest optimal SLOs based on service characteristics
- [ ] **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns in service behavior that might affect SLO setting
- [ ] **Alert Effectiveness Analysis**: Analyze how effective suggested alerts would have been against historical incidents

## Web Interface

- [ ] **Web UI**: Create a simple web interface for users who prefer graphical interfaces
- [ ] **Shareable Results**: Generate shareable links for collaboration
- [ ] **Dashboard**: Create dashboards for monitoring multiple services' SLOs
- [ ] **Team Collaboration**: Allow teams to collaborate on SLO definitions
- [ ] **Version Control**: Track changes to SLO definitions over time

## Documentation and Help

- [ ] **Interactive Tutorial**: Create an interactive tutorial for first-time users
- [ ] **Contextual Documentation**: Provide context-sensitive help throughout the application
- [ ] **Glossary**: Include a glossary of SLO/SLI terms accessible from the CLI
