# Open Issues and Improvements

This document tracks potential improvements and issues for the SLO Computer project.

## Code Organization and Structure

- [ ] Reorganize command files into a dedicated `cmd` package
- [ ] Create separate packages for service and CPU-related functionality
- [ ] Improve function and variable naming for clarity
- [ ] Add more comprehensive documentation to exported functions
- [ ] Refactor long functions into smaller, more focused ones

## Error Handling

- [ ] Standardize error messages across the application
- [ ] Improve user-facing error messages with more actionable information
- [ ] Add validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Implement proper error wrapping with context
- [ ] Add recovery mechanisms for panics in initialization code

## Testing

- [ ] Add unit tests for core SLO calculation functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for CLI commands
- [ ] Create test fixtures for common scenarios
- [ ] Add benchmarks for performance-critical code
- [ ] Implement test coverage reporting

## User Experience

- [ ] Improve output formatting with better visual separation
- [ ] Add color coding for critical information in terminal output
- [ ] Provide more examples in help text
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running calculations
- [ ] Support output in different formats (JSON, YAML, etc.)
- [ ] Present error rates as percentages rather than decimal values (0.2% instead of 0.002000)
- [ ] Format time durations in a more human-readable way
- [ ] Clearly label "slow burn" and "fast burn" alerts in the output
- [ ] Add contextual explanations for alert recommendations
- [ ] Provide implementation guidance for popular monitoring systems

## Code Quality

- [ ] Replace magic numbers with named constants
- [ ] Add more type safety for domain-specific values
- [ ] Implement linting in CI pipeline
- [ ] Add code quality checks to prevent regression
- [ ] Improve variable naming for better readability

## Feature Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for more AWS instance types
- [ ] Extend support to other cloud providers (GCP, Azure)
- [ ] Implement visualization of burn rates and alert thresholds
- [ ] Add export functionality for alerting systems (Prometheus, Datadog, etc.)
- [ ] Support for multi-window, multi-burn-rate alerting policies
- [ ] Add historical data analysis for SLO recommendation

## Documentation

- [ ] Expand README with more detailed explanations of SLO concepts
- [ ] Add mathematical models and formulas documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples for common scenarios
- [ ] Add architectural documentation
- [ ] Create contributor guidelines
- [ ] Develop a visual guide explaining multi-window, multi-burn-rate alerting
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common alert implementation issues

## Dependencies and Build

- [ ] Update to a newer version of Go (1.20+)
- [ ] Update dependencies to latest versions
- [ ] Modernize GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Add Dependabot for automated dependency updates
- [ ] Implement module versioning strategy

## Configuration

- [ ] Add support for configuration files (YAML, TOML)
- [ ] Implement environment variable support for CI/CD environments
- [ ] Add configuration validation
- [ ] Support for profiles/presets for common scenarios
- [ ] Add ability to save and load configurations

## Performance
